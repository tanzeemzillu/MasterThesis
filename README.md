# MasterThesis

My master thesis topic was "Integration and Evaluation of Kubernetes and
Docker swarm in combination of Docker Compose"

The main purpose of this master thesis is to build two different clusters based on Docker swarm and Kubernetes respectively and evaluate the performance of both clusters based on some defined use cases. In the theoretical part of this thesis work will cover the container technology, Docker container, Docker compose, container orchestrator, Docker swarm, Kubernetes etc. The thesis implementation will cover the cluster setup for both Docker swarm and Kubernetes, necessary networking for cluster, application deployment, scaling, load balancing, container update
and rollback, container live migration and performance analysis. Finally, in this thesis there is an evaluation between Docker swarm and Kubernetes based on the results from all experiments
